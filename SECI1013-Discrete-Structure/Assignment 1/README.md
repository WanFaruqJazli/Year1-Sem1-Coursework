## 📌 Overview
This repository serves as a log for **Assignment 1 (Section 02)**. This was a group task focused on **Chapter 1: Set Theory & Logic**. Unlike my computer lab assignments, this task was completed manually on paper to practice formal mathematical notation and proofs.

---

## 📝 Task Description
We were required to solve **6 different questions** covering various topics in discrete mathematics. The assignment had to be written neatly on plain A4 paper.

**The questions required us to:**
1.  **List Sets:** Identify and list down the specific elements within a set.
2.  **Set Proofs:** Prove a set identity by showing every step and stating the specific Set Laws used.
3.  **Counting:** Calculate the number of students in a group using set formulas (Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion).
4.  **Logic Analysis:** Consider a statement and determine its logical properties.
5.  **Truth Tables:** Construct truth tables to verify if two compound propositions (A and B) are logically equivalent.
6.  **Direct Proof:** Perform a mathematical proof using the method of Direct Proofing.

## 🚀 Work Process
Here is how our group approached the assignment:
1.  **Discussion:** We met to discuss the questions and share ideas on how to solve the proofs.
2.  **Drafting:** We worked out the truth tables and calculations on rough paper first.
3.  **Finalizing:** We wrote the final answers neatly on plain A4 paper as required.
4.  **Submission:** We compiled the pages with our cover sheet and submitted the hard copy directly to the lecturer.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository
Even though there is no digital file for this specific assignment, I am using this entry to:
* Track my completion of the Set Theory & Logic module.
* Record the details of the coursework I have finished.
* Maintain a complete timeline of my academic progress in this subject.
