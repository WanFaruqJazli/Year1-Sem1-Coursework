## 📌 Overview
This entry logs my work for **Assignment 1 (Section 02)**. This was a group task focused on **Chapter 1: Set Theory & Logic**. Unlike my computer lab assignments where I usually type code, this task was done the old school way. We completed everything manually on paper to really practice our formal mathematical notation and hand-written proofs.

## 📝 Task Description
We were tasked with solving **6 different questions** that covered the core topics of discrete mathematics. We had to write everything neatly on plain A4 paper.

**The questions challenged us to:**
1.  **List Sets:** We had to identify specific elements and list them clearly within a set.
2.  **Set Proofs:** This involved proving a set identity. We had to show every single step and state exactly which Set Law we were using for each line.
3.  **Counting:** We calculated the number of students in a specific group using set formulas like the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion.
4.  **Logic Analysis:** We looked at a given statement and had to break down its logical properties.
5.  **Truth Tables:** This required constructing full truth tables to verify if two different compound propositions were logically equivalent.
6.  **Direct Proof:** We performed a formal mathematical proof using the Direct Proofing method.

## 🚀 Work Process
Here is how my group tackled the assignment:
1.  **Brainstorming:** We met up to discuss the questions first. It was helpful to bounce ideas off each other, especially for the proof questions.
2.  **Drafting:** We didn't write on the final paper immediately. We worked out the messy truth tables and calculations on rough paper to make sure our logic was sound.
3.  **Finalizing:** Once we were confident in the answers, we wrote the final versions neatly on the A4 paper.
4.  **Submission:** We compiled all the pages with our cover sheet and submitted the hard copy to the lecturer.

## 💭 Reflection

### 💡 What I Learned
* **Precision Matters:** I realized that in logic and proofs, being "close enough" is not good enough. Every step needs to be justified. Writing it out by hand actually helped me slow down and check my own logic flow.
* **The Power of Truth Tables:** Constructing the truth tables was a bit tedious at first, but it is actually a very powerful way to visually see if two complex statements are actually saying the same thing.

### 📈 Suggestions for Improvement
* **Digital Tools:** While writing by hand is good practice, I think allowing us to use tools like LaTeX for future assignments would be a great skill to learn. It keeps the math looking professional and clean.
* **More Proof Examples:** The Direct Proof question was the trickiest part for me. I think having a few more practice examples of this specific method during class would make it easier to approach these problems with confidence.
