## 📌 Overview
This repository records my work for **Assignment 2 (Section 02)**. The focus of this task was **Chapter 2: Relation, Function & Recurrence**. Unlike the previous assignment, this one fell during our midterm break, so even though we wrote our solutions by hand on A4 paper, we had to scan and submit them as a **soft copy** via eLearning.

---

## 📝 Task Description
We were required to solve **7 comprehensive questions** that tested our understanding of discrete mathematical structures.

**The questions covered three main areas:**

### 1. Relations
* **Analysis:** Listing elements, domains, and ranges of a relation $R$.
* **Visuals:** Drawing the digraph of the relation and checking if it is asymmetric.
* **Matrices:** Constructing the matrix of relation and listing in-degrees/out-degrees.
* **Properties:** Determining if a relation is a Partial Order Relation.

### 2. Functions
* **Types:** Determining whether a function is one-to-one, onto, or bijective.
* **Operations:** Finding the inverse function and calculating composition functions.

### 3. Recurrence & Recursion
* **Recurrence Relations:** Writing the relation and finding specific values (like $P_5$).
* **Algorithms:** Writing a recursive algorithm to calculate the $n^{th}$ term of a sequence and tracing the steps manually (e.g., computing $s_4$).

## 🚀 Work Process
Here is how our group approached the assignment:
1.  **Collaboration:** We discussed the 7 questions together to ensure we understood the logic for each proof and calculation.
2.  **Manual Solving:** We wrote the solutions neatly on plain A4 paper, ensuring all diagrams and matrices were drawn clearly.
3.  **Digitization:** Since this was due during the break, we scanned our handwritten pages to create a digital copy.
4.  **Submission:** We compiled the file and submitted it through the UTM eLearning platform.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository
I am using this repository to:
* Keep a digital record of my handwritten assignments.
* Track my mastery of Relations, Functions, and Recursion algorithms.
* Maintain a complete portfolio of my coursework for this semester.
