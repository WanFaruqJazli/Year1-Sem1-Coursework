## 💭 Reflection

> "Throughout this course, I developed essential mathematical understanding for computer science, including set theory, relations, functions, and graph theory. I discovered how logic, proofs, and combinatorics play important roles in algorithms and data structures."

### 🛠️ Key Highlights
* **Critical Thinking:** The lessons encouraged me to think more critically and logically, which helped me solve problems more systematically in both programming and system development.

* **Suggestion for Improvement:** In my opinion, using more real-world examples and coding-related tasks would make some of the abstract ideas easier to relate to.

### 🚀 Conclusion
Overall, I now see how mathematical thinking supports nearly every aspect of computing from database structures to software engineering, and I apply these concepts not only in mathematical tasks but also in coding and system design.
