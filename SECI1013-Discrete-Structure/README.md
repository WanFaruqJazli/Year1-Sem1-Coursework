### 📝 Introduction
> "Logic is the foundation of all computing."

This course introduced me to the mathematical principles that actually power Computer Science. It wasn't just about solving equations; it was about learning the abstract concepts that build strong logical reasoning. These are the problem-solving skills I know I will need as I progress in Data Engineering.

## 💭 Student Reflection

### 💡 Key Highlights
* **🧠 Critical Thinking:** The logic exercises in this class really pushed me to think systematically. I realized that coding is less about just knowing the syntax and more about understanding the logical flow behind it.
* **🔗 Mathematical Foundation:** I finally connected the dots between math and code. It was cool to see how *Graph Theory* powers data structures like networks, and how *Logic* is basically the brain behind every algorithm.

### 📈 Suggestions for Improvement
* *Real-World Application:* The theory was solid, but I would have loved to see more code examples. Seeing how to implement a graph in C++ right alongside the math would have made the abstract concepts much easier to grasp.

### 🚀 Reflection
Overall, I can see now how mathematical thinking backs up almost every part of computing, from database structures to software engineering. I find myself applying these concepts not just when I'm doing math, but when I'm trying to optimize my code and design better systems.
