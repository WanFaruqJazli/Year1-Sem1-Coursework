## 📌 Overview
This entry logs my work for **Assignment 1 (Section 02)**. This was a pair assignment where we had to work together to design a logic system. We were assigned **Set 2**, which required us to create the logic for a **Loan Calculator**.

## 📝 Task Description
The goal was to design a flowchart that helps users estimate their monthly loan installments. This is a practical tool for anyone trying to plan their finances better.

To solve this, we had to:
1.  **Analyze:** We studied the sample output provided in the question to understand exactly what the user needed to see.
2.  **Design:** We constructed a flowchart that would produce that exact output.
3.  **Structure:** We had to make sure the logic flowed correctly from the Start node all the way to End.

### ⚙️ Technical Requirements
The lecturer required us to apply specific programming concepts in our diagram:
* **Branching:** We used `if..else` statements to make decisions based on user input.
* **Loops:** We implemented a `do..while` loop to allow the program to repeat if the user wanted to calculate another loan.
* **Functions:** We used **User-Defined Functions**. Aside from the main function, we created a specific function to handle the calculation logic separately.

## 🚀 Work Process
Here is how my partner and I approached the assignment:
1.  **Understanding:** We started by breaking down the loan calculation formula. We needed to know exactly which variables were inputs and which were outputs.
2.  **Drafting:** We sketched the flow on paper first. This helped us decide where to place the loops and how to separate the calculation into its own function.
3.  **Refining:** We double-checked the arguments we were passing to the functions to ensure the data was moving correctly between them.
4.  **Submission:** Once the logic looked solid, we saved the file and submitted it via eLearning.

## 💭 Reflection

### 💡 What I Learned
* **Visualizing Logic:** This assignment taught me that coding is easier when you draw it out first. Seeing the logic flow on paper helped me catch errors in the loop structure that I might have missed if I just started coding immediately.
* **Modular Thinking:** Using a specific function for the calculation made the flowchart much cleaner. It showed me why breaking big problems into smaller chunks is a core rule in programming.

### 📈 Suggestions for Improvement
* **Error Handling:** Our current flowchart assumes the user enters perfect numbers. I think adding checks for invalid inputs, like negative numbers for the loan amount, would make the logic much more robust.
* **Complexity:** The current logic is quite linear. To challenge ourselves, we could have added different interest rate tiers based on the loan amount to make the calculator more realistic.
