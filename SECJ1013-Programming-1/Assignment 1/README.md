## 📌 Overview
This repository contains my personal record for **Assignment 1 (Section 02)**. This task was a group assignment where we had to work in pairs. We were assigned **Set 2**, which required us to design a logic system for a **Loan Calculator**.

---

## 📝 Task Description
The main goal was to create a flowchart that helps users estimate their monthly loan installments to plan their finances better.

To solve this, we had to:
1.  **Analyze:** Look at the sample output provided in the question.
2.  **Design:** Construct a flowchart that produces the exact same output.
3.  **Structure:** Ensure the logic flows correctly from start to finish.

### ⚙️ Technical Requirements
The lecturer required us to apply specific logic structures in our flowchart:
* **Branching:** We used `if..else` statements to make decisions.
* **Loops:** We used a `do..while` loop (repeat..until) to allow the program to repeat.
* **Functions:** We had to use **User-Defined Functions**. Aside from the main function, we created at least one extra function with appropriate arguments to handle specific calculations.

## 🚀 Work Process
Here is how we approached the assignment:
1.  **Understanding:** We studied the loan calculation formula and the output requirements.
2.  **Drafting:** We sketched the flow of the program, deciding where to put the loops and the functions.
3.  **Refining:** We checked if the arguments passed to the functions were correct.
4.  **Submission:** We saved the file with the correct naming format and submitted it via eLearning.
