## 📌 Overview
This entry serves as my personal archive for **Assignment 2 (Section 02)**. This was a collaborative task where I worked with a partner to complete **Set 2**. Our goal was to translate logic into a fully functional C++ program by developing a **Car Loan Calculator** specifically for Proton vehicles.

## 📝 Task Description
The primary objective was to build a tool that allows users to estimate monthly loan installments for different car models like the X50, Exora, and Persona. This helps users manage their financial planning more effectively.

To achieve this, we followed these steps:
1.  **Review:** We analyzed the sample output provided in the assignment brief to understand exactly what was needed.
2.  **Develop:** We wrote a C++ program that calculates the monthly payment based on variables like car price, down payment, interest rate, and the loan period.
3.  **Implement:** We ensured the code utilized the specific programming constructs required by the lecturer.

### ⚙️ Technical Requirements
We integrated the following C++ elements into our solution:
* **Selection:** We applied `if..else` statements to handle different car model selections and region specific costs (Peninsular vs East Malaysia).
* **Repetition:** We utilized a `do..while` loop to allow users to perform multiple calculations without having to restart the program every time.
* **Modularization:** We implemented a User-Defined Function named `calcpayment` to handle the mathematical formulas. This kept the calculation logic separate from the main interface.

## 💭 Reflection

### 💡 Key Highlights
* **Bridging Theory and Practice:** Working on this calculator was a fantastic way to bridge the gap between abstract algorithms and actual coding. It helped me understand how to turn a logical concept on paper into a working application.
* **The Power of Functions:** This task really reinforced the value of modular programming. Breaking the calculation logic into the `calcpayment` function made the code much easier to read and debug compared to stuffing everything into `main`.
* **Collaborative Learning:** Working with a partner was a highlight. Discussing the logic together helped us refine the program faster than I could have done alone, and it gave me more confidence in tackling real programming problems.

### 📈 Suggestions for Improvement
* **Input Validation:** Currently, the program assumes the user always types the correct car code. I think adding error handling for invalid inputs would make the application feel much more robust and professional.
* **Data Scalability:** We hardcoded the prices for the specific car models. For a future version, using arrays or vectors to store a larger inventory of cars would be a much more efficient way to handle the data.
