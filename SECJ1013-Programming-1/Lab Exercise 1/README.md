## 📌 Overview
This repository contains my personal record for **Lab Exercise 1 (Section 02)**. The main goal of this task was to practice logic design by creating a flowchart based on a specific problem set given by the lecturer.

---

## 📝 Task Description
I was assigned **Set 1**. The task was to design a flowchart that performs the following logic:

1.  **Input:** Read an integer number from the user.
2.  **Process:** Calculate the **sum of all digits** in that number.
3.  **Check:** Identify if the calculated sum is a multiple of **3, 4, and/or 5**.

### ⚙️ Technical Requirements
To solve this, I had to follow these specific rules:
* Use the **Division (/)** and **Modulus (%)** operators to separate the digits.
* Use a **Post-Test Loop** (like a Do-While loop) to repeat the process.

## 🚀 Work Process
Here is how I approached the exercise:
1.  **Analysis:** I looked at the example output provided in the question to understand exactly what the program should do.
2.  **Design:** I constructed the flowchart to handle the math and the loop correctly.
3.  **Formatting:** I saved the file using the specific naming format requested by the lecturer.
4.  **Submission:** I submitted the final flowchart through the eLearning platform.
