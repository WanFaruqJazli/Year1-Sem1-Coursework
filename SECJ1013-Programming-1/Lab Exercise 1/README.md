## 📌 Overview
This entry serves as my personal record for **Lab Exercise 1 (Section 02)**. The main goal of this task was to practice logic design by creating a flowchart based on a specific problem set. It was a good exercise to test my ability to visualize a program before actually writing the code.

---

## 📝 Task Description
I was assigned **Set 1**. The challenge was to design a flowchart that performs the following logic:

1.  **Input:** The system reads an integer number provided by the user.
2.  **Process:** It calculates the **sum of all digits** in that number.
3.  **Check:** Finally, it identifies if that calculated sum is a multiple of **3, 4, or 5**.

### ⚙️ Technical Requirements
To solve this, I had to follow these specific rules:
* Use the **Division (/)** and **Modulus (%)** operators to mathematically separate the digits one by one.
* Use a **Post-Test Loop** (like a Do-While loop) to ensure the process repeats as needed.

## 🚀 Work Process
Here is how I approached the exercise:
1.  **Analysis:** I started by looking at the example output in the question. This helped me understand exactly what the user is supposed to see and input.
2.  **Design:** I sketched out the flowchart. The trickiest part was figuring out the loop condition and making sure the math for extracting digits was correct.
3.  **Formatting:** Once the logic looked good, I saved the file using the specific naming format requested by the lecturer.
4.  **Submission:** I submitted the final flowchart through the eLearning platform.

## 💭 Reflection

### 💡 Key Highlights
* **The Math of Logic:** I learned a really useful technique for extracting digits. Using `% 10` to get the last digit and `/ 10` to remove it is a standard logic pattern that I know I will use in future coding tasks.
* **Loop Logic:** This exercise clarified the difference between pre-test and post-test loops. I saw why a post-test loop is useful here because we always want the code to run at least once to process the user's input.

### 📈 Suggestions for Improvement
* **Input Handling:** The current flowchart assumes the user enters a positive integer. I think adding a check for negative numbers or non-integer inputs would make the logic much more robust.
* **Step-by-Step Tracing:** To improve my understanding, I think adding a "trace table" alongside the flowchart would be helpful. It would allow me to manually track the variable values through each iteration of the loop to prove the logic works.
