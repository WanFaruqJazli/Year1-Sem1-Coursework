## 📌 Overview
This entry serves as my personal record for **Lab Exercise 2 (Section 02)**. The main goal of this task was to take the logic we designed in the previous flowchart exercise and translate it into a **complete C++ program** that actually works.

---

## 📝 Task Description
I worked on **Set 1** again. The challenge was to write code that performs the following steps:

1.  **Input:** Ask the user to enter an integer number.
2.  **Process:** Calculate the **sum of all the digits** in that number.
3.  **Check:** Check if that calculated sum is a multiple of **3, 4, or 5**.

### ⚙️ Technical Requirements
My code had to follow these specific rules:
* Use the **Division (/)** and **Modulus (%)** operators to mathematically split the numbers.
* Use a **Post-Test Loop** (do-while loop) to ensure the program executes the logic at least once before checking the condition.

## 🚀 Work Process
Here is how I completed the exercise:
1.  **Analysis:** I reviewed the sample output provided by the lecturer to understand exactly how the program should behave when running.
2.  **Coding:** I wrote the C++ code to handle the math for extracting digits and the logic checks for the multiples.
3.  **Testing:** I ran the code multiple times with different numbers to make sure it produced the exact output required by the question.
4.  **Submission:** I saved the file with the specific naming convention and uploaded it to eLearning.

## 💭 Reflection

### 💡 Key Highlights
* **From Diagram to Code:** This exercise really helped me see the connection between design and implementation. It was satisfying to see the flowchart I drew in Lab 1 turn into a working program.
* **Syntax Precision:** I realized that while logic is important, syntax is just as critical. I had to be very careful with the semicolon after the `while` condition in the do-loop, which is a common mistake I managed to avoid.

### 📈 Suggestions for Improvement
* **Modular Code:** Currently, I wrote all the logic inside the `main` function. For future exercises, I think it would be better to create a specific function like `int calculateSum(int n)` to handle the math. This would make the main code much cleaner and easier to read.
* **User Experience:** The program just ends after one run. Adding a loop that asks "Do you want to try another number? (Y/N)" would make the program much more user-friendly and interactive.
