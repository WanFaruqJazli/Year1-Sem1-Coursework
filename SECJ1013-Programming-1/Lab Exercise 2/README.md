## 📌 Overview
This repository contains my personal record for **Lab Exercise 2 (Section 02)**. The main goal of this task was to take the logic we learned in the previous exercise and write a **complete C++ program** that actually works.

---

## 📝 Task Description
I was assigned **Set 1** again. The task was to write a code that does the following:

1.  **Input:** Ask the user to enter an integer number.
2.  **Process:** Calculate the **sum of all the digits** in that number.
3.  **Check:** Check if that sum is a multiple of **3, 4, and/or 5**.

### ⚙️ Technical Requirements
My code had to follow these specific rules:
* Use the **Division (/)** and **Modulus (%)** operators to split the numbers.
* Use a **Post-Test Loop** (do-while loop) to make sure the program runs correctly.

---

## 🚀 Work Process
Here is how I completed the exercise:
1.  **Analysis:** I looked at the sample output the lecturer gave us to see how the program should look when it runs.
2.  **Coding:** I wrote the C++ code to handle the math and the logic checks.
3.  **Testing:** I ran the code to make sure it gave the same output as the question.
4.  **Submission:** I saved the file with the correct name and uploaded it to eLearning.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository
I am using this repository to:
* Keep a backup of my coding exercises.
* Track how much I am learning in C++.
* Record the work I have finished for my coursework.
