## 💭 Reflection

### 💡 Key Highlights
* **🎙️ Stepping Up as an Interviewer:** Taking on the role of Researcher and Interviewer pushed me out of my comfort zone. I enjoyed speaking directly with the UTMDigital staff to uncover their real-world challenges. It was a great opportunity to practice professional communication.
* **🔧 Behind the Scenes:** It was inspiring to see the backend of the university. Realizing that there are passionate teams working constantly to keep our digital campus running changed my perspective on the services I use every day.

### 📈 Suggestions for Improvement
* **Digital Navigation:** The event was packed, which was great, but it was hard to find specific booths. Having a QR code map or clearer signage would help students plan their route so they do not miss the important technical exhibits.
* **More Interactive Demos:** While the talks were informative, having more hands-on demonstrations where we could try out the systems or see live coding would make the experience even more engaging for tech students.
