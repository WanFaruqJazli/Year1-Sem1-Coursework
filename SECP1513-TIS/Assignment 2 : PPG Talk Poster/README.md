## 📌 Summary of the Talk
We attended a talk by **PPG**, a huge global company famous for paints and coatings. They shared how their **MY Technology Centre** supports their operations worldwide using three main digital areas:

* **SAP Centre of Excellence (CoE)**
    This team uses a system called S/4HANA to help the company manage its business processes and keep everything running smoothly across different countries.

* **IT Infrastructure & Vendor Management**
    They focus on the hardware and networks. Their job is to make sure the Cloud systems and internet connections (WAN/LAN) are secure and stable for everyone.

* **Data Analytics Centre of Excellence (CoE)**
    This was about turning raw data into useful information. They use tools like SQL and Python to help the company make smarter business decisions.

## 📝 Reflection

> "As a first-year student, this talk really opened my eyes. Before this, I thought PPG just sold paint, but I learned they are actually a massive tech-driven company that supplies coatings for things we use daily, like phone screens and drink cans.
>
> The best advice they gave was about our careers. They told us that having a 4.0 CGPA isn't enough. To really stand out, we need to have hands-on experience, technical skills, and good soft skills.
>
> Seeing the different teams—like Cloud, SAP, and Data Analytics—helped me understand how many different IT roles work together. It made me realize that to be a good Data Engineer, I need to be good at coding but also good at solving logic problems. I am really excited to learn more so I can work in a place like this one day."

## 🔧 Suggestions for Improvement
* **Show Real Examples:** It would be cooler if they showed us a real problem PPG faced and how they fixed it using data.
* **More Q&A Time:** We had a lot of questions, so a longer Q&A session would be helpful to learn from the experts.
* **Share the Slides:** It would be great if we could get a copy of the slides to look back at the technical info later.
