## 📌 Summary of the Talk
We attended a talk by **PPG**, a huge global company famous for paints and coatings. They shared how their **MY Technology Centre** supports their operations worldwide using three main digital areas:

* **SAP Centre of Excellence (CoE)**
  This team uses a system called S/4HANA to help the company manage its business processes and keep everything running smoothly across different countries.

* **IT Infrastructure & Vendor Management**
  They focus on the hardware and networks. Their job is to make sure the Cloud systems and internet connections (WAN/LAN) are secure and stable for everyone.

* **Data Analytics Centre of Excellence (CoE)**
  This was about turning raw data into useful information. They use tools like SQL and Python to help the company make smarter business decisions.

## 💭 Reflection

### 💡 Key Highlights
* **📱 Beyond Just Paint:** This talk was honestly an eye-opener. I used to think PPG just sold wall paint, but I was surprised to learn how tech-driven they are. Finding out they engineer the coatings for everyday items, like our smartphone screens, really changed how I view the industry.
* **🎓 Skills Over Grades:** One of the biggest takeaways for me was hearing that a 4.0 CGPA isn't everything. The speakers emphasized that real experience and soft skills matter just as much as grades. That was a relief to hear and motivated me to focus more on hands-on learning.
* **🗺️ Clarifying My Path:** Seeing how the different teams like Cloud, SAP, and Data Analytics work together really clarified my career roadmap. I realized that being a Data Engineer is about balancing coding with business logic, and I am motivated to start building those specific skills now.

### 📈 Suggestions for Improvement
* **Real-World Case Studies:** It would be even cooler if they showed us a specific problem PPG faced and exactly how they fixed it using data. Seeing the "before and after" would make the technical concepts much easier to understand.
* **Extended Q&A:** We had a lot of questions at the end, but the time was quite limited. A longer Q&A session would be helpful so we can dig deeper into the topics with the experts.
