## 📌 Summary of the Talk
We attended a talk by **PPG**, a huge global company famous for paints and coatings. They shared how their **MY Technology Centre** supports their operations worldwide using three main digital areas:

* **SAP Centre of Excellence (CoE)**
    This team uses a system called S/4HANA to help the company manage its business processes and keep everything running smoothly across different countries.

* **IT Infrastructure & Vendor Management**
    They focus on the hardware and networks. Their job is to make sure the Cloud systems and internet connections (WAN/LAN) are secure and stable for everyone.

* **Data Analytics Centre of Excellence (CoE)**
    This was about turning raw data into useful information. They use tools like SQL and Python to help the company make smarter business decisions.

## 📝 Reflection

> "Honestly, this talk was an eye-opener. I used to think PPG just sold paint, but I was surprised to learn how tech-driven they are, coating everyday items like our phone screens.
>
> The biggest takeaway was that a 4.0 CGPA isn't everything. They emphasized that real experience and soft skills matter just as much. Seeing how teams like Cloud, SAP, and Data Analytics work together really clarified my path. I realized being a Data Engineer is about balancing coding with logic, and I’m motivated to start building those skills now."

## 🔧 Suggestions for Improvement
* **Show Real Examples:** It would be cooler if they showed us a real problem PPG faced and how they fixed it using data.
* **More Q&A Time:** We had a lot of questions, so a longer Q&A session would be helpful to learn from the experts.
* **Share the Slides:** It would be great if we could get a copy of the slides to look back at the technical info later.
