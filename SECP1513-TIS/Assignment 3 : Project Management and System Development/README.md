## 📌 Summary of the Talk
The session was delivered by **Tuan Hj. Abdul Alim**, who emphasized that the future of Computer Science isn't just about writing code—it's about understanding the entire system. He highlighted three major pillars for building a strong career foundation:

* **System Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**
    Development isn't just typing syntax. It follows a strict standard: Defining → Designing → Testing → Implementing. This ensures the software actually works for the user.

* **Project Management Methodologies**
    To stop projects from becoming chaotic, we need structured approaches like **Waterfall** or **Agile**. These methods help control complexity and keep the team working together efficiently.

* **The Shift to System Architecture**
    We need to stop thinking of ourselves as just "Coders." In the age of AI, our role is shifting to "System Architects"—professionals who design the blueprint and manage AI agents to build sophisticated software.

## 📝 Reflection

> "As a first-year student, this talk was a huge wake-up call. I used to think my degree was mostly about learning programming languages, but Tuan Hj. Abdul Alim introduced us to the 'New Success Formula': **40% Coding & AI + 60% System Management**.
>
> He warned us about the **'FYP Trap'** , here students wait until their final year to learn how to actually build a complete system. That really resonated with me. I realized I can't wait; I need to start thinking like a System Architect now.
>
> The idea of 'Agentic Coding' was also fascinating. Instead of fearing that AI will replace us, I learned that I need to be the one controlling the AI. This talk motivated me to look beyond just the code and focus on the bigger picture of how secure and reliable systems are designed."

## 🔧 Suggestions for Improvement
* **More Q&A Time:** The topics were quite advanced, so having extra time for students to ask questions would clarify the harder concepts.
* **Access to Slides:** Since there was a lot of technical info, having the slides to review later would be very helpful for our studies.
