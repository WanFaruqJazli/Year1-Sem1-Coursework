## 📌 Summary of the Talk
The session was delivered by **Tuan Hj. Abdul Alim**, who emphasized that the future of Computer Science is not just about writing code. It is about understanding the entire system. He highlighted three major pillars for building a strong career foundation:

* **System Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**
  Development is not just typing syntax. It follows a strict standard: Defining → Designing → Testing → Implementing. This ensures the software actually works for the user.

* **Project Management Methodologies**
  To stop projects from becoming chaotic, we need structured approaches like **Waterfall** or **Agile**. These methods help control complexity and keep the team working together efficiently.

* **The Shift to System Architecture**
  We need to stop thinking of ourselves as just "Coders." In the age of AI, our role is shifting to "System Architects." These are professionals who design the blueprint and manage AI agents to build sophisticated software.

## 💭 Reflection

### 💡 Key Highlights
* **🚨 The Wake-Up Call:** This talk was a massive reality check for me. I used to think my degree was mostly about mastering programming languages, but Tuan Hj. Abdul Alim introduced us to the "New Success Formula" which is **40% Coding & AI** and **60% System Management**.
* **🏗️ Avoiding the "FYP Trap":** He warned us about students who wait until their Final Year Project (FYP) to learn how to actually build a complete system. That really resonated with me. I realized I cannot wait until my final year; I need to start thinking like a System Architect right now.
* **🤖 Embracing Agentic Coding:** The concept of "Agentic Coding" was fascinating. Instead of fearing that AI will replace us, I learned that I need to be the one controlling the AI. It motivated me to look beyond just the code and focus on the bigger picture of designing secure and reliable systems.

### 📈 Suggestions for Improvement
* **Extended Q&A:** The topics covered were quite advanced and technical. I think having extra time specifically for students to ask questions would help us clarify the harder concepts immediately.
* **Digital Handouts:** Since there was so much valuable technical information shared, having access to the slides or a summary handout to review later would be extremely helpful for our studies.
