## 📝 Session Summary
Our first lab focused on the practical side of computer hardware. Following a detailed demonstration by the lecturer on safe handling techniques, we worked in groups to disassemble and reassemble a Personal Computer. We got hands-on experience with sensitive components like the motherboard, RAM, and hard disk, ensuring the system could boot successfully after reassembly. The session concluded with a quiz to gauge our understanding of the components and procedures.

## 🧠 Reflection
> "Being a first-year student, this lab was a very revealing experience. It was my first opportunity to actually open a computer case and examine the internal components closely. Watching the instructor demonstrate the process made me realize the precision required when dealing with sensitive hardware.
>
> Working in a group of six, we took turns handling various parts, checking connections, and ensuring the PC booted properly. It was exciting to see the theoretical material from lecture slides translate into a real, tactile activity.
>
> Beyond the technical knowledge gained, I discovered that I learn best by doing—inspecting and installing parts myself helps me understand how the system works together. The session also boosted my confidence in handling hardware and improved my patience and communication skills while coordinating tasks with my teammates. I am grateful to Dr. Aryati bt Bakri for this hands-on learning opportunity."

## 🔧 Suggestions for Improvement
* **Increase Practical Time:** Allocate more duration for the hands-on portion so every student has the chance to handle more components individually.
* **Additional Toolsets:** Provide extra sets of tools to minimize waiting time during collaborative group work.
* **Troubleshooting Exercise:** Introduce a brief segment focused on solving common issues (e.g., identifying why a PC won't boot) to build real-world problem-solving skills.
* **Procedural Checklist:** Supply a quick guide or checklist for students to review before starting and upon completion of the lab.
