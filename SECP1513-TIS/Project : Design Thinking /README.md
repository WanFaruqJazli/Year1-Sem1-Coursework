## 📌 Project Summary: UniFlow
For this project, we tackled a common struggle at the UTM cafeteria which is the lack of seats during peak hours and the alarming amount of food waste. We developed **UniFlow**, a smart application designed to smooth out the cafeteria experience.

* **The Problem**
    We found that students were stressed out trying to find seats between 1 PM and 2 PM. On top of that, cafe owners were losing money because of food waste and inefficient crowd management.

* **Our Solution**
    We followed the Design Thinking process (Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test) to create a comprehensive system. We interviewed students and staff to really understand their pain points before writing a single line of code.

* **Key Features**
    * **UniFlow Mobile App:** The central hub where students can check real-time crowd levels, pre-order meals to skip lines, and view seat availability.It also helps cafe owners track sales and waste data.
    * **AI-Driven Camera System:** This detects empty seats and notifies students via the app so they know exactly where to sit.
    * **Smart Food Lockers:** A "buy and go" system where students pre-order meals and pick them up from a locker to skip the long queues.
    * **Smart Waste Bins:** To tackle waste, we designed a bin with a scale. It gamifies the experience by awarding points to students who finish their food, which helps convert waste into organic fertilizer.

## 📝 Reflection

> "This project really shifted my perspective. Before this, I honestly thought my degree was just about writing code and managing databases. But Design Thinking taught me that we have to understand the human side of the problem first.
>
> We realized that it does not matter how advanced the technology is if it does not solve the user's actual stress. Moving from just 'coding' to 'problem-solving' was a big step for me. It helped me see that to be a successful Data Engineer in the future, I need to build systems that are not just technically strong but also practical for the people using them. It is about empathy just as much as it is about logic."
