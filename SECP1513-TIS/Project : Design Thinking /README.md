## 📌 Project Summary: UniFlow
For this project, we tackled a common struggle at the UTM cafeteria. We focused on the lack of seats during peak hours and the alarming amount of food waste. To solve this, we developed **UniFlow**, a smart application designed to smooth out the cafeteria experience.

* **The Problem**
    We found that students were stressed out trying to find seats between 1 PM and 2 PM. On top of that, cafe owners were losing money because of food waste and inefficient crowd management.

* **Our Solution**
    We followed the Design Thinking process (Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test) to create a comprehensive system. We interviewed students and staff to really understand their pain points before writing a single line of code.

## 🔑 Key Features

* 📱 **UniFlow Mobile App**
    The central hub where students can check real-time crowd levels, pre-order meals to skip lines, and view seat availability. It also helps cafe owners track sales and waste data.

* 📷 **AI-Driven Camera System**
    This detects empty seats and notifies students via the app so they know exactly where to sit without wandering around.

* 🔐 **Smart Food Lockers**
    A "Buy & Go" system where students pre-order meals and pick them up from a secured locker to skip the long queues.

* ♻️ **Smart Waste Bins**
    To tackle waste, we designed a bin with a scale. It gamifies the experience by awarding points to students who finish their food, which helps convert waste into organic fertilizer.

## 💭 Reflection

### 💡 Key Highlights
* **🧠 Beyond the Code:** This project really shifted my perspective. Before this, I honestly thought my degree was just about writing code and managing databases. Design Thinking taught me that we have to understand the human side of the problem first.
* **❤️ Empathy Over Technology:** I realized that it does not matter how advanced the technology is if it does not solve the user's actual stress. Moving from just "coding" to "problem-solving" was a big step for me.
* **🚀 Future Data Engineer:** It helped me see that to be a successful Data Engineer, I need to build systems that are not just technically strong but also practical for the people using them. It is about empathy just as much as it is about logic.

### 📈 Suggestions for Improvement
* **Real-World Testing:** We only created a digital prototype for this assignment. I think the project would be much stronger if we could actually test the "Smart Waste Bin" concept in the real cafeteria to see if students are motivated by the gamification points.
* **Technical Integration:** Connecting the AI camera system to the mobile app in real-time is a complex challenge. In the future, I would like to explore exactly how to handle that data stream to make sure the app updates instantly without lag.
