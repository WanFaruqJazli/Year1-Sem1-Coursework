### 📝 Introduction
> "Technology is the tool, but information systems are the blueprint for how organizations work."

This course served as my big-picture introduction to the IT landscape. Instead of focusing on just one coding language, it provided a holistic view of the entire ecosystem, covering everything from the physical hardware we touch to the cloud networks that store our data. It emphasized how these technologies actually support decision-making in real-world organizations.

## 💭 Student Reflection

### 💡 Key Highlights
* **🛠️ Hands-on Hardware:** The **PC Assembly Lab** was a standout moment for me. Getting to actually handle the components and assemble a machine made the abstract hardware concepts click in a way that reading slides never could.
* **🏢 Real-World Insight:** The **PPG Industry Talk** was eye-opening. It went beyond the textbook to show us what real job roles look like and the actual skills employers are hunting for right now.
* **🔄 Understanding Development:** The **Serunai Talk** on System Development was equally impactful. It clarified the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and Agile methodologies, showing me exactly how modern software projects are structured and managed.

### 📈 Suggestions for Improvement
* *More Practical Labs:* Since the PC Assembly Lab was so effective, I would love to see even more practical sessions. Hands-on interaction really makes the learning experience feel meaningful.
* *Continued Industry Engagement:* The industry sharing sessions were incredibly helpful for career planning. Having more of these sessions, perhaps covering different sectors of IT, would be a great addition for future students.

### 🚀 Conclusion
Overall, this course connected the dots for me. It motivated me to not only focus on building technical skills but to think about how to apply them in real contexts. I now have a much stronger understanding of how IT professionals drive value across different industries.
