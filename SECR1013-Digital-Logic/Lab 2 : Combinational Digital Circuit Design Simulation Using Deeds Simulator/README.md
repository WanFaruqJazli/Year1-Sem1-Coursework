## 📖 Overview
In this lab, we moved away from the physical hardware and focused on **software simulation**. We learned the basics of designing, simplifying, and optimizing logic circuits using **Boolean algebra** and **K-maps**.

The main activity was using the **Deeds Simulator (d-DcS)** to do three things:
1.  Draw the digital circuits on the computer.
2.  Create timing diagrams to see how signals change.
3.  Check if our logic was correct using the animation mode.

## 🎯 Objectives
The main goals for this session were:
- [x] **Learning the Software:** We wanted to learn how to create circuits and generate Truth Tables using the Deeds software.
- [x] **Full Design Process:** We practiced the whole process of designing a circuit, starting from a word problem and finishing with a working simulation.

| **Deeds Simulator (d-DcS)** | This is the program we used to draw and test our circuits. It lets us click switches on the screen to see the inputs and outputs change in real time. |

## 🧪 Laboratory Work

### Part 1: Circuit Analysis & Simplification
**Task:** We were given a logic circuit and had to figure out the Boolean equation for it.
* **Simplification:** We used De Morgan’s Theorem to make the equations smaller using **Sum of Product (SOP)** and **Product of Sum (POS)** forms.
* **Verification:** We checked if our math was correct by building the circuit in Deeds and comparing the results.

### Part 2: The "LRT Coach Door" Design Challenge
**Task:** We had to design a circuit to control an LRT train door. The outputs were `OPEN` and `ALARM`. We had to decide when the door should open based on if the train was moving and which station (`S1`, `S2`, `S3`) it was at.

**The Design Process:**
1.  **Logic Definition:** First, we looked at the requirements and made a Truth Table.
2.  **Optimization:** We used **Karnaugh Maps (K-Maps)** to find the simplest equation possible.
3.  **Implementation:** We built the optimized circuit inside the Deeds Simulator.
4.  **Universal Gates:** We changed the final design to use **only NAND gates** to show that NAND gates can do everything.

## 📝 Reflection

> "Moving from the real chips to computer simulation was a big change for me. Before this, I only did the math on paper, but this session let me visualize the signals moving through the wires on the screen.
>
> Learning the Deeds software was really useful. I liked the LRT Coach Door project because I had to start from scratch. I had to make the Truth Table and then use K-Maps to make it simple. It was a bit hard to change everything to NAND gates, but it was a great feeling when I pressed the simulation button and everything worked perfectly.
>
> Overall, this lab helped me connect the math I learned in class with actual circuit design. I feel much more confident now in reading timing diagrams and finding mistakes in my logic."
