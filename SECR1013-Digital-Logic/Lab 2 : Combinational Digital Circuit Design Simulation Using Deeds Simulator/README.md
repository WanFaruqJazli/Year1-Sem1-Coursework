## 📖 Overview
In this lab, we moved away from the physical hardware and focused on **software simulation**. We learned the basics of designing, simplifying, and optimizing logic circuits using **Boolean algebra** and **K-maps**.

The main activity was using the **Deeds Simulator (d-DcS)** to do three things:
1.  Draw the digital circuits on the computer.
2.  Create timing diagrams to see how signals change.
3.  Check if our logic was correct using the animation mode.

## 🎯 Objectives
The main goals for this session were:
- [x] **Learning the Software:** We wanted to learn how to create circuits and generate Truth Tables using the Deeds software.
- [x] **Full Design Process:** We practiced the whole process of designing a circuit, starting from a word problem and finishing with a working simulation.

## 🧪 Laboratory Work

### Part 1: Circuit Analysis & Simplification
**Task:** We were given a logic circuit and had to figure out the Boolean equation for it.
* **Simplification:** We used De Morgan’s Theorem to make the equations smaller using **Sum of Product (SOP)** and **Product of Sum (POS)** forms.
* **Verification:** We checked if our math was correct by building the circuit in Deeds and comparing the results.

### Part 2: The "LRT Coach Door" Design Challenge
**Task:** We had to design a circuit to control an LRT train door. The outputs were `OPEN` and `ALARM`. We had to decide when the door should open based on if the train was moving and which station (`S1`, `S2`, `S3`) it was at.

**The Design Process:**
1.  **Logic Definition:** First, we looked at the requirements and made a Truth Table.
2.  **Optimization:** We used **Karnaugh Maps (K-Maps)** to find the simplest equation possible.
3.  **Implementation:** We built the optimized circuit inside the Deeds Simulator.
4.  **Universal Gates:** We changed the final design to use **only NAND gates** to show that NAND gates can do everything.

## 💭 Reflection

### 💡 Key Highlights
* **From Paper to Screen:** Moving from real chips to computer simulation was a big change for me. This session helped me visualize the signals moving through the wires in a way that static diagrams on paper never could.
* **The Design Flow:** The LRT project forced me to start from scratch. I had to build the Truth Table, use K-Maps to simplify it, and then construct the circuit. It was challenging, but pressing the simulation button and seeing it work perfectly was a great feeling.

### 📈 Suggestions for Improvement
* **More Complex Scenarios:** The LRT example was great, but I think trying a slightly more complex design, like a traffic light controller, would really push our skills with timing diagrams further.
* **Error Debugging:** It would be helpful to have a specific exercise where we are given a broken circuit file and have to find the mistake. Learning how to debug someone else's logic is a skill I think is really important.
