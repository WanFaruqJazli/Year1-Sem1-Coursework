## 📖 Overview
This lab session shifted focus from physical hardware to the **software simulation** of digital logic. We explored the fundamental principles of combinational logic circuit design, simplification, and optimization using **Boolean algebra** and **K-maps**.

The core activity involved using the **Deeds Simulator (d-DcS)** to:
1.  Construct digital networks.
2.  Generate timing diagrams.
3.  Verify logic behaviors through interactive animation.

## 🎯 Objectives
The primary goals of this session were to:
- [x] **Master the Tool:** Learn to produce digital logic circuits and generate Truth Tables/Timing Diagrams using Deeds.
- [x] **End-to-End Design:** Experience the complete cycle of a combinatorial circuit design (from problem statement to simulation).

## 🧪 Laboratory Work

### Part 1: Circuit Analysis & Simplification
**Task:** Given a specific logic circuit, we had to derive its initial Boolean expressions.
* **Simplification:** Expressions were reduced to **Sum of Product (SOP)** and **Product of Sum (POS)** forms using De Morgan’s Theorem.
* **Verification:** Manual calculations were cross-referenced by simulating the circuit in Deeds to generate truth tables and timing waveforms.

### Part 2: The "LRT Coach Door" Design Challenge
**Task:** Design a logic circuit to control an LRT coach door (Output: `OPEN` and `ALARM`) based on the coach's movement status and arrival at specific stations (`S1`, `S2`, `S3`).

**The Design Process:**
1.  **Logic Definition:** Defined input/output relations and constructed the Truth Table.
2.  **Optimization:** Used **Karnaugh Maps (K-
