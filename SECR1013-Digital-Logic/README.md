### 📝 Introduction
> "Understanding the hardware level is the first step to mastering the software level."

This subject was my introduction to the absolute core principles of digital systems. I learned how computers actually handle information, not through abstract code, but through binary representation and logic gates. It provided the foundational tools, like Boolean algebra, that allowed me to understand how to design and analyze the digital circuits that power our devices.

## 💭 Student Reflection

### 💡 Key Highlights
* **🧠 Analytical Growth:** This subject really strengthened my problem-solving abilities. Designing logic circuits wasn't just about drawing lines; I had to think critically about how signals flow and change states. It gave me a solid mental model of how computers operate at the hardware level.
* **🔌 From Theory to Practice:** The hands-on activities were crucial for me. seeing how basic components connect to create functioning hardware made the abstract math real. The lab sessions and project work took the equations off the page and turned them into something I could actually test and verify.

### 📈 Suggestions for Improvement
* *More Lab Activities:* Since the hands-on aspect was so helpful for visualizing complex designs, I hope even more lab-based activities or project assignments can be introduced in the future. Building circuits is definitely the best way to understand them.

### 🚀 Conclusion
Overall, I gained a much deeper understanding of the essential building blocks behind computer hardware. I realized that complex digital systems are really just simple logical operations combined in clever ways. This knowledge bridges the gap between my code and the physical machine running it.
