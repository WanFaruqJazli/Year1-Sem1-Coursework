## 💭 Student Reflection

### 💡 Key Highlights
* **⚖️ Beyond Technical Skills:** This course taught me a valuable lesson. True success is not just about having great technical skills. It requires a strong commitment to moral values. I realized that without integrity, professional achievements lose their value.
* **🛡️ Understanding Impact:** I gained a deeper appreciation for how corruption damages economic stability and trust. Learning about the actual legal frameworks and the SPRM Act made the issue feel much more real and urgent.

### 📈 Suggestions for Improvement
* *Interactive Learning:* I think the course would be even more impactful with more interactive elements. Adding role-playing scenarios or video assignments would help make the concepts of integrity stick and feel more personal.

### 🚀 Conclusion
Ultimately, this subject reshaped my perspective on professional conduct. It reinforced the idea that maintaining high ethical standards is essential. I now see it as my responsibility to contribute to a corruption-free society, not just for my own character development but for the good of the community.
